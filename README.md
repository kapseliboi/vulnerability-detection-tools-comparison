# vulnerability-detection-tools-comparison
This repository contains scripts for running multiple vulnerability detection tools at once


## Requirements

- Node.js and npm (I used version 14.16.1 and 6.14.11)
- @cyclonedx/bom installed globally (I used version 3.0.3)
- Git
- OWASP Dependency Check CLI (I used version 6.2.2, installation: https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-cli/)
- Authenticated Snyk CLI installed (I used version 1.658.0)
- Authenticated GitHub CLI or unauthenticated with an access token
- Unix find command available in path
- GitHub.com enterprise account (without it dependabot results might be incorrect as many manifest files are too large to analyze without an enterprise account)

## Functionality

### Select

Selects projects based on a provided JSON file which has to be produced by GitHub Search or be in the same format. It checks the amount of dependencies in the repository and
if it meets the minimum requirement for dependencies it gives a link to the user to the repository for the user to manually inspect its suitability.
Then the user simply selects if it accepts it or not. Then the project is saved to the database for later analysis. This project uses TypeORM so the type of database is freely configurable.
Some extra work is also done regarding later analysis with repository based tools.
The project is forked and Dependabot is enabled using an authenticated GitHub CLI.

### Analyze

Produces results with all the tools and saves them to ./results/${GitHub username}/${Repository name}/${Commit hash}
